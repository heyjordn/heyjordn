There's no denying that technology is constantly evolving, and with it, the skills needed to work with it. This can make it difficult for engineers to keep up and can even be overwhelming at times. But despite the ever-changing nature of it, one thing remains constant: the importance of spending time to **learn deeply**.

Learning deeply and by extension "being proficient" means more than just having a basic understanding of how "it" works. It means being able to use a given tool effectively and efficiently in a variety of situations. It also means being able to troubleshoot problems and find solutions when things don't go as planned (and things will most definitely **not** go as planned). In short, proficiency with a tool can be the difference between success and failure in today's fast-paced, technology-driven world.

But how much time does it actually take to become proficient? The answer, unfortunately, is not a simple one. The amount of time it takes to become proficient can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, including the complexity of the technology, the individual's prior knowledge and experience, and most importantly the **time and effort** they are willing to put into learning and practicing.

In general, it is safe to say that it can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months to become proficient in a particular tool/technology. This may seem like a long time, but it is a worthwhile investment. Not only will it improve your skills and increase your value as a professional, but it will also give you the confidence and knowledge to tackle new challenges and opportunities as they arise.

But becoming proficient is not just about putting in the time and effort. It's also about diving deep into the subject area and gaining a thorough understanding of the underlying concepts and principles. This means taking the time to learn not just the how, but also the why of the technology, knowing **why** it exists. It means going beyond and gaining a deep understanding of it and its capabilities.

Diving deep can be challenging, but it is essential for achieving proficiency. It allows you to see the bigger picture and understand how the particular technology fits into the overall landscape of the ecosystem of frameworks and tools. It also enables you to make connections between different technologies and see how they can work together to solve complex problems.

One of the most important (I think) things  for aspiring engineers to remember is that it takes **time**. Let me repeat that. **It takes time to become proficient in a technology**. It is not something that can be achieved overnight, and it is important for engineers to be patient and to give themselves time to learn and grow.

Be realistic about the amount of time and effort it takes to become proficient. It is not something that can be achieved quickly or easily, and it is important to set aside the time and resources needed to learn and practice.

Be kind to yourself and not be too hard on yourself if they you don't see immediate results. Learning a technology is a process, and it is important to be patient and to celebrate small victories along the way.

The reality is that no one becomes a great engineer overnight. It takes time, effort, and a lot of hard work to gain the knowledge and skills needed to be successful in the field. Even the most talented and gifted engineers have had to put in the time and effort to become proficient in their chosen technology. Time and effort that was definitely **not** shown on their twitter feed. It might seem like an oversimplification but it's very easy to think that engineers are learning and producing at light speed, it's even easier to think "wow, Im learning so slow, I have to speed this up and get this technology **today**". Stop! Don't cheat yourself, slow down and pace your learning. That tool that popular author published today **took time**, that book they're writing **took time**, it all **takes time**.
